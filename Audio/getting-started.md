# Getting Started

By the end of this document the reader should aptly be able to bring the A/V system from turned off to full functioning and vice versa. (Closing the service down would require you to just do all of these steps backwards) Let's dive in.

## Step 1 - Lighting

First start by being on time. Find out when the music team is practicing (typically at 8:40am if the team has practiced that week, 8:30am if they haven't practiced that week, and 8:20am if the kids choir plan on singing) and be there 15 mins before to promptly give yourself enough time to get everything running and tested. If you're not there ready when they start practicing you're missing 50% of the positions responsibility, which is to make sure everything is working as expected. Think of this time as rehearsal, you wouldn't appreciate going to a stage theater and the man in charge of the lights missed his mark and didn't highlight a key scene.
Start by walking into the auditorium by turning on various lights through out the back wall of the auditorium by the main entrance. Which lights need to be turned on are a bit confusing so if you are unsure which ones, they can be left and the building administrator will come through when opening up and turn them on. The main lights are on the left when you first walk into the booth. The stage lights are on your left when facing the sound board. You'll notice they have small sliders on them. They should be turned up all the way.

## Step 2 - Boot Up

Start the boot up process by turning the keys that are in the left and right racks underneath the sound booth desk. This will take roughly 3-4 minutes so you can move on to other tasks while the power is turning on.

While waiting you can navigate to the livestream room and ensure that the mac behind the livestream monitor is on.

If the livestream mac is already ready to go, log into the computer and launch:

Return to the booth and you should see that the Mac Mini is on, if it is not, this means the Mac Mini was turned off. Turning it on is as simple as pressing the power button on the bottom left corner until you hear the famous startup sound.

If the keyboard and mouse are both unresponsive, they need to be turned on.

The soundboard gets turned on with a manual I/O switch found on the back bottom right of the board:
