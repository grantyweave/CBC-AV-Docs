# Getting Started

By the end of this document the reader should aptly be able to bring the A/V system from turned off to full functioning and vice versa. (Closing the service down would require you to just do all of these steps backwards)

First start by being on time. Find out when the music team is practicing (typically at 8:40am if the team has practiced that week, 8:30am if they haven't practiced that week, and 8:20am if the kids choir plan on singing) and be there 15 mins before to promptly give yourself enough time to get everything running and tested. If you're not there ready when they start practicing you're missing 50% of the positions responsibility, which is to make sure everything is working as expected. Think of this time as rehearsal, you wouldn't appreciate going to a stage theater and the man in charge of the lights missed his mark and didn't highlight a key scene.

Let's dive in.

## Step 1 - Lighting

Start by walking into the auditorium by turning on various lights through out the back wall of the auditorium by the main entrance. Which lights need to be turned on are a bit confusing so if you are unsure which ones, they can be left and the building administrator will come through when opening up and turn them on. The main lights are on the left when you first walk into the booth. The platform lights are on your left when facing the sound board. You'll notice they have small sliders on them. They should be turned up all the way. Another task that should be done right away is removing all of the old batteries from the microphones and putting them on the charger.

## Step 2 - Boot Up

Start the boot up process by turning the keys that are in the left and right racks underneath the sound booth desk. It will take roughly 3-4 minutes before the everything is finish turning on, so you can move on to other tasks while the power is turning on.

While waiting you can navigate to the livestream room and ensure that the mac behind the livestream monitor is on.

- Find Livestream Mac (wall mounted behind the monitor)

If the livestream mac is already ready to go, log into the computer and launch:

- Logic Pro ![logic_pro_logo](<../MISC Pics/logic_pro_app_icon.png>)

(Go here to learn more about getting the livestream up and running)

Return to the booth and you should see that the Mac Mini is on, if it is not, this means the Mac Mini was turned off. Turning it on is as simple as pressing the power button on the bottom left corner until you hear the famous startup sound.

If the keyboard and mouse are both unresponsive, they need to be turned on.

- Apple Mouse Power Slider ![apple_mouse_power_slider](<../MISC Pics/apple-magic-mouse_power_slide.jpg>)

The soundboard gets turned on with a manual I/O switch found on the back bottom right of the board:

The projectors turn on by using the three remotes found on top of the right rack:

At this point everything should be ready to operate but smaller details will need to be completed to ensure that these processes work
as expected. (e.g. fresh charged batteries being added to every microphone/mic pack)

## Step 3 - Run

In order to make sure everyone who needs to be heard or seen can be, some things need to be addressed.

### Microphones

Every microphone that gets used needs fresh batteries the morning of service. Rechargeable batteries can be found in the livestream room on the tool bench, sitting in the charger (In the event of a rechargeable breaking or there not being enough, there are regular AA batteries in the tool bench in the right 2nd drawer top to bottom.) Any rechargeable battery that was used the previous week should be put back on the charger.

There are:

- 2-3 Singers with handheld mics (The lead singers mic is on the mic stand, the 2nd lead mic sits around the left baptismal steps)
- 2-3 Speakers with Mic Packs (Pastor Ken's mic pack will be found in his office, on his desk. Pastor Larry's mic pack is on the built-in shelf in the sound booth and any extra handhelds will be on that shelf.)

### Instruments/Speakers

On the sound board while it can be intimidating on approach, there is only two sections that are of concern to the average operator:

- Mute Groups
- Shut Down/Restart via the `Setup` button.

#### Mute Groups

Mute groups are how an operator can simply mute a large amount of inputs in the press of a button. However, it is important to know the difference between an individual input mute and a mute group mute.

- Input Mute: When an inputs (e.g. Input named `Guitar 1`) mute button is a solid red, this means that you must manual unmute the button by pressing the input mute button on the specific input.
- Mute Group Mute: When an inputs mute button is blinking red, this means it is muted via the mute group & the only way to unmute it, is through unmuting the mute group.

Why is it so important to make a distinction? The reason being that this is how an operator can get caught in what's called a `double mute` which can cause major confusion during a service. Let's give a scenario where the Main Speaker is going up to talk but we can't hear him. The `Main Speaker` input is muted on the `Speaker 1` mute group as well as the individual input mute button. The current operator is unaware of this double mute scenario so in order to hear the speaker when the speaker goes up to talk he goes to press the `Mute Group` button labeled `Speaker 1`, the speaker begins to talk but he can't hear him. Why? Panic sets in. This is because even though the operator unmuted the mute group, the speaker is still muted on the individual input mute button. Now that the operator knows this, he always checks to make sure that he is using the Mute Groups a majority of the time and if he faces this issue, he can check to make sure that double muting is not occurring.

#### Shut Down/Restart

Shutting down the board is pretty straight forward. Navigate to the `Setup` button (1), press the Shut Down button in the top right (2) and you will be prompted to wait until the board is ready. When it is ready, it will give you an on screen option to select the `Restart` button or the system will now be ready for you to turn it off manually on the back of the board.

### Soundbooth computer

The only applications that _need_ to be open during service is Apple Music & Proclaim.

In order to create a more comfortable atmosphere, we like to play light background music (usually I set the music at -30dbs). This can be played as soon as the music team is done practicing. The playlists that can be used are `CBC Pre-Service (inst.)`, `CBC Pre-Service (vocals)`, or `Matin`.
