# Getting Started

By the end of this document, the reader should be able to bring the A/V system from turned off to fully functioning and vice versa. To close the service, simply perform these steps in reverse.

Start by arriving on time. Check when the music team is practicing (typically 8:40 AM if they practiced that week, 8:30 AM if they haven’t, or 8:20 AM if the kids’ choir is singing). Arrive 15 minutes early to ensure enough time to set up and test the system. Being ready when practice begins is critical, as 50% of your responsibility is ensuring everything works as expected. Think of this as a rehearsal—missing your cue is like a theater technician failing to light a key scene.

Let’s dive in.

## Step 1 - Lighting

Begin by entering the auditorium and turning on the lights along the back wall near the main entrance. The specific lights can be confusing, so if you’re unsure, the building administrator will turn them on during opening. The main lights are on the left as you enter the booth. The platform lights are on your left when facing the soundboard, equipped with small sliders that should be turned up fully. Immediately remove old batteries from the microphones and place them on the charger.

## Step 2 - Boot Up

Initiate the boot-up process by turning the keys in the left and right racks under the sound booth desk. The system takes about 3–4 minutes to fully power on, allowing you to perform other tasks during this time.

While waiting, go to the livestream room and ensure the Mac behind the livestream monitor is on.

- Find Livestream Mac (wall-mounted behind the monitor)

If the livestream Mac is ready, log in and launch:

- Logic Pro <img src="../MISC Pics/logic_pro_app_icon.png" alt="logic_pro_logo" width="300">

(Refer to additional resources for detailed livestream setup instructions.)

Return to the booth and check the Mac Mini. If it’s off, press the power button on the bottom left corner until you hear the startup sound.

If the keyboard and mouse are unresponsive, turn them on:

- Apple Mouse Power Slider <img src="../MISC Pics/apple-magic-mouse_power_slide.jpg" alt="apple_mouse_power_slider" width="300">

Turn on the soundboard using the manual I/O switch on the back bottom right:

Activate the projectors using the three remotes on top of the right rack:

At this point, the system should be operational, but ensure smaller details, like installing fresh batteries in microphones and mic packs, are completed.

## Step 3 - Run

To ensure everyone is heard and seen, address the following:

### Microphones

All microphones require fresh batteries on the morning of the service. Find rechargeable batteries on the charger in the livestream room’s tool bench. If there aren’t enough or a battery fails, regular AA batteries are in the second drawer from the top on the right side of the tool bench. Place used rechargeable batteries back on the charger.

Microphones include:

- 2–3 singers with handheld mics (lead singer’s mic is on the mic stand; the second lead mic is near the left baptismal steps).
- 2–3 speakers with mic packs (Pastor Ken’s is on his office desk; Pastor Larry’s and extra handhelds are on the sound booth’s built-in shelf).

### Instruments/Speakers

The soundboard may seem intimidating, but operators focus on two areas:

- Mute Groups
- Shut Down/Restart via the `Setup` button

#### Mute Groups

Mute groups allow muting multiple inputs with one button. Understand the difference between:

- **Input Mute**: A solid red mute button (e.g., for `Guitar 1`) requires manually unmuting the specific input.
- **Mute Group Mute**: A blinking red mute button indicates the input is muted via a mute group, which must be unmuted through the group.

Distinguishing these prevents a “double mute” issue, where an input is muted both individually and via a group, causing confusion. For example, if the main speaker’s mic is muted on both the `Speaker 1` mute group and its individual input, unmuting only the group won’t work. Always use mute groups primarily and check for double muting if issues arise.

#### Shut Down/Restart

To shut down the soundboard, navigate to the `Setup` button (1), press the Shut Down button in the top right (2), and wait for the prompt. When ready, select the `Restart` button or manually turn off the board at the back.

### Soundbooth Computer

During the service, only Apple Music and Proclaim need to be open.

To create a comfortable atmosphere, play light background music (set to -30 dB) after the music team’s practice. Use playlists: `CBC Pre-Service (inst.)`, `CBC Pre-Service (vocals)`, or `Matin`.
